# Hoarder Bug Respawn Mod
I sat down and did some thinking. The Hoarding Bugs are just a rival company, they mean no harm and act exactly the same as players.
So for the players who are out of line: if a Hoarding Bug gets killed, 5 Hoarding Bugs spawn

# [Releases](https://github.com/LunaSakura154/LC_BugRespawnMod/releases/)

## 1.0.0
This version currently only includes the basic Hoarding Bug spawning function (who knows if I add more)
